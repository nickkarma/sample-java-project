# Sample Java Project

This is a reference for setting up a new Ant-based Java project. It
contains most of the little Ant tricks I've learned over the
years. When I start a new Java project I clone this repository, remove
sections of build.xml that I don't care about for that particular
project, set the project properties, clear out the sample sources, and
get to work.
